Friend Finder Application 

Author: Morgan Hamlin

Description: This application uses a combination of node.js and express.js to create an API that matches a user's survey responses to that of other users. The app is deployed through heroku. The user that is defined as their best match is then displayed on the screen.

Logic: Users answer 10 questions and provide a response for each between 1 (strongly disagree) and 5 (strongly agree). When the user submits their responses, they are then compared to other users in the database and their total difference score calculated. 

Instructions: Simply follow the link in my portfolio, fill out the survey, and find your best match!
